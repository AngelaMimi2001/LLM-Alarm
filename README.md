# Echotune ‚Äì Smart Voice-Controlled Alarm

Echotune is a **smart, voice-controlled reminder system** that integrates **LLM-based natural language understanding**, **music playback**, and **ambient lighting** to deliver personalized alarms.  
It is designed as a **hardware + software** system and requires the accompanying Arduino-based device to run properly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Hardware Dependency**  
   - This project requires the **Arduino-based hardware** (with LED and OLED screen) I built specifically for this system.  
   - The Python code alone will not produce the full experience without connecting to this hardware.

2. **API Keys**  
   - Replace the placeholders in `Echotune.py` with **your own API credentials**:  
     - **OpenAI API key**  
     - **Spotify client ID and secret**  
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never upload personal API keys to a public repository.**

3. **Environment**  
   - Tested on **Python 3.8+** and **Arduino Uno**  
   - Works on both Windows and macOS (adjust COM port as needed)
